In workplaces, more than a million new pages of data are created every minute of the day. Computer utilization may allow for the reduction of some administrative costs while maintaining a constant level of processing activity in comparison to traditional processing methods. Eventually, management must pay attention to the rising costs of the data processing operation's clerical personnel, supplies, and other charges. Internally, electronic voting systems have many functions, including encryption, randomization, communication, and security systems. A specific analysis of these functionalities goes beyond the immediate scope of this paper. For a basic understanding of what e-voting systems can do, however, it is useful to consider the following list of some of the end-user functionalities that such systems can provide to both voters and election officials.
•	Electronic voter lists and voter authentication. Part of an electronic voting system can be an electronic voter list, covering either a single polling station or the entire country. This list can be used to authenticate eligible voters and to record that they have cast their vote.
•	Poll worker interfaces. Special functionalities that are only available to poll workers, for example, resetting the vote count at the opening of the polling station, closing polling, printing, and transmission of results.
•	Interfaces for casting votes. These include touch screens, optical mark recognition (OMR) ballot papers that are fed into a scanner, touch-sensitive tablets, push buttons, web pages or special client software for Internet voting.
•	Special interfaces for handicapped voters. These include Braille or audio input devices for the blind, easier access for voters with physical disabilities, and simpler interfaces for illiterate voters.
